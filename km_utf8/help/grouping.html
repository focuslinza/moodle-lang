<h1>Grouping</h1>

<p>A grouping is a collection of <a href="help.php?module=moodle&amp;file=groupmode.html">groups</a>
 within a course - a new concept introduced in Moodle 1.8.
</p>

<p>It is intended that different groupings can be used for different course activities
 (only implemented for wikis), so for example the groups in a "Collaboration Grouping" 
 would be used for a group wiki, while groups in "Discussion Grouping" are used for a 
 forum activity.
</p>

<p>On the course module settings page, simply keep the default [Any grouping],
 or select the grouping you wish to use and save your changes.
