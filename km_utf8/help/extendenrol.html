<h1>Extend enrolment</h1>
<p>This page allows you to extend the enrolment period for the participants. 
The new enrolment period is computed based on a starting reference date and an extend period from that date.
Depending on this combination you can actually restrict the enrolment period for participants.</p>

<p>The available starting reference dates are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Course start date</li>
<li>Enrolment Started - the enrolment start date of the participant (this option is available only for users with known enrolment start date)</li>
<li>Enrolment Ends - the enrolment end date of the participant (this option is available only for users with limited enrolment period)</li>
<li>Today (this option in available only if the course start date has past)</li>
<li>Course enrolment start date - the enrolment start date from the course settings page (this option is available only for courses with defined enrolment start date)</li>
<li>Course enrolment end date - the enrolment end date from the course settings page (this option is available only for courses with defined enrolment end date)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the extend period is set to 'Not changed' or 'Untitled', then the starting reference date is ignored.</p>
