Moodle Hindi Translation
by Utkarshraj Atmaram <utcursch@gmail.com>

-----------------------------------------------------------
I am a Mozilla Firefox supporter, but unfortunately, 
Mozilla family's rendering of some "matra"s
is a bit flawed, so some words will look weird in 
Mozilla Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers.

-----------------------------------------------------------
If a string is missing for any reason from Hindi language pack
then the English version will be used.

Each installed activity module in moodle/mod should have a file 
here, as well as the main file which is called "moodle.php".

The "help" directory contains whole pages written in HTML,
and the "docs" directory contains other miscellaneous 
documents. If you are thinking of translating Moodle to 
another language, please contact Martin Dougiamas!
