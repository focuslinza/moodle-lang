Korean
------

The Korean Moodle Translation Project is a collaborative effort led by Timothy  Allen of Hannam University. 

There are two Korean language packs in Moodle: this one is "ko" and has an EUC-KR encoding.  

It would be appropriate for courses in which Korean is the only or the predominant language, 

but not for courses with a lot of text in two or more languages.  

Due to the planned shift of Moodle to unicode this language will soon be superseded 

by the "ko_utf8" pack which has a unicode (UTF-8) encoding and which is appropriate for all kinds of sites.  

"ko_utf8" is now the default language pack for Korean Moodle and users are encouraged to use it rather than this one.


Project Contributors include:
-----------------------------
 Timothy Allen (co-ordinator)
 Kui In Keem
 Park Wang Kyu
 Lee Yong-keun 
 Lee Chan-young (translators)
 (and more)

Current state of the project:
-----------------------------
Finally the screen interface is virtually 100% complete.  

The next priority is to correct errors in the completed translation and to finish translating the help and documentation files.  

There is always a need for collaborators.  

If you have any time to volunteer to help finish the translation as soon as possible please do not hesitate to contact me! (contact details below)
