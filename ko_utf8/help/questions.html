<h1>질문하기</h1>

<p>다른 사람이 어떤 주제에 대하여 생각할 수 있도록 돕는 좋은 방법은 그 주제에 대하여 질문을 하는 것입니다. 좋은 질문은 정보를 함께 공유할 수 있는데 도움이 될 뿐만 아니라, 기존 아이디어를 평가해 보고 또 새로운 아이디어를 창출하는 데도 도움이 됩니다.</p>

<p>다른 사람으로 하여금 학습할 수 있도록 유도하는 전형적인 질문법은 옛 그리스의 소크라테스로부터 유래한 소위 <i>소크라테스의 산파법</i>이 있습니다.</p>

<p>소크라테스의 산파법의 요체는 다른 사람의 발언을 아주 주의깊게 경청한다는 것입니다. 그래서 여러분들이 강압적인 방법을 쓰지 않고도, 상대방을 파악하여 건설적이고 유익한 질문을 구안해 낼 수 있기 때문입니다.</p>

<p>다음은 그러한 질문법의 사례를 보인 것입니다.</p>
